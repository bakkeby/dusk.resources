These are additional helper tools that can be used standalone or as part of status scripts.

By default some scripts expect that the content of the tools directory is placed under `~/bin/`.

## pulse

This directory contains a few pulse audio scripts to adjust volume, toggle mute, etc. that also
trigger status updates for the volume status script.

## relabel.sh

A minor example script that changes the window class of the active window. This can be used for
demo purposes changing the labels used in the bar when the
[WorkspaceLabels](https://github.com/bakkeby/dusk/wiki/WorkspaceLabels) functionality is enabled.
