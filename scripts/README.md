Here are some example scripts that can be used with the [dusk](https://github.com/bakkeby/dusk)
window manager if desired.

## context_menu

These are example context menu scripts intended to be used with
[xmenu](https://github.com/phillbush/xmenu).

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/bakkeby/dusk/wiki/System#context-menus) page.

By default some scripts expect that the `context_menu` directory is placed under `~/bin/`.

## statusbar

These are example scripts for updating the different statuses on the status bar.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/bakkeby/dusk/wiki/Status-Module) page for more details on
this.

By default some scripts expect that the `statusbar` directory is placed under `~/bin/`.

## tools

These are additional helper tools that can be used standalone or as part of status scripts.

By default some scripts expect that the content of the tools directory is placed under `~/bin/`.
